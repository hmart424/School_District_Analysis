# School District Analysis

## Overview of Analysis 

The purpose of todays analysis is to remove any inaccuracies from the data, while keeping data intact and running a new analysias. We filtered data by total school budget, per student capita, average math and reading score, the passing percent for math and reading, and the overall passing percentage.

## Results 

Some of the results vary but for the most part much of the data remained the same. This makes sense given that we had a large set of data, and removing only a small portion of the data would not drastically skew the data.

## Summary

Four changes that i noticed on the dataset were the number of total students, the number of students counted at Thomas High School, the average math and reading scores, and the overall percentages for math and reading at Thomas High School. Due to the fact that these score and percentage changes were minimal, we can assume that the removal of math and reading scores of 9th graders at Thomas High School not as significant as we would imagine it to be.
